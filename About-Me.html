                <h5>Currently a York University Undergrad (4th year)</h5>
                <p> 
                    <br> Hello! I'm a young Nigerian-Canadian with a passion for learning, innovation, and soccer. After completing my secondary school education in Nigeria, I immigrated to Canada, where I completed grades 11 and 12, eventually graduating with a high school diploma. I am now in my fourth year at York University in Toronto, and I look forward to graduating in about a year.</br>

<br> In my time in Nigeria, I was proud to achieve 4th place in the national Swedish Water Prize project, a competition focused on finding solutions to non-biodegradable waste polluting smaller water bodies across the earth. Additionally, I served as the student body president for the 2018/2019 academic session, demonstrating my leadership skills and commitment to my peers.</br>

<br> As an avid soccer fan, I have always had a deep love for the sport and even considered pursuing a professional career. Upon moving to Canada, I continued playing soccer while also dedicating myself to my academic pursuits. My passion for technology led me to improve my programming skills through both formal education and self-directed learning, utilizing resources such as YouTube to enhance my knowledge.</br>

<br> I am currently at a point where I would love to focus on my professional career and grow as an individual. To do so, I have decided to pursue an internship in the software engineering/development world. I believe this opportunity will provide me with valuable experience and knowledge that I can implement in my career after graduation.</br>

<br> I am excited to continue my journey, leveraging my diverse experiences and skills to make a meaningful impact in the world. Feel free to <a href="mailto:shubi0411@gmail.com"> contact me </a> if you have any additional questions.</br>
